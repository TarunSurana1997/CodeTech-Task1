Overview of the Project
Project: Quiz Model based on c++ Programming

Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive console-based Quiz Application using C++. The application aims to provide users with a set of multiple-choice questions on general knowledge topics and evaluate their performance based on their responses.

Key Activities
Design User Interface and Questions: Plan the console layout and create a set of multiple-choice questions with answer options.
Implement Input Handling and Scoring: Capture user answers, validate input, and develop a scoring system to track correct and incorrect answers.
Provide Feedback and Manage Console: Give instant feedback on answers, clear the console after each question, and use text colors for emphasis.
Display Final Score and Test: Calculate and show the user's total score at the end of the quiz, and test the application to ensure it works correctly.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
seaborn: Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.

Key Insights
Population Distributions: Histograms to show how populations have been distributed over time.
Inter-year Relationships: Scatter plots to reveal relationships between population data from different years.
Correlation Patterns: Heatmaps to display the correlation between populations over the years, highlighting significant trends and patterns.
This project provides a comprehensive overview of global population trends and insights, useful for further studies or policy-making related to demographic changes.
