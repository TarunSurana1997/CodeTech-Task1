### Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive console-based Quiz Application using C++. The application aims to provide users with a set of multiple-choice questions on general knowledge topics and evaluate their performance based on their responses.

### Key Activities
- **Design User Interface and Questions**: Plan the console layout and create a set of multiple-choice questions with answer options.
- **Implement Input Handling and Scoring**: Capture user answers, validate input, and develop a scoring system to track correct and incorrect answers.
- **Provide Feedback and Manage Console**: Give instant feedback on answers, clear the console after each question, and use text colors for emphasis.
- **Display Final Score and Test**: Calculate and show the user's total score at the end of the quiz, and test the application to ensure it works correctly.

### Technologies Used
- **Development Environment, Compiler & IDE**:Such as Visual Studio, or any C++ compatible IDE for writing and debugging the code with GCC Compiler to run and compile the files.
- **Libraries**:
-   <iostream>: Standard C++ library for input and output operations.
-   <windows.h>: Windows API library for handling console text color and other console-specific functions.
- **Console Commands**: system("cls"): To clear the console screen.

### Key Insights
- **Interactive User Interface**: The use of colored text and clear console management enhances the user experience by making the quiz visually appealing and easy to navigate.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Providing instant feedback on answers helps users learn and understand their mistakes, reinforcing correct information.
- **Score Tracking**: A simple and effective scoring system motivates users by giving them a tangible measure of their performance.
- **Input Validation**:  Ensuring valid user input improves the reliability of the application and prevents errors during the quiz.
- **Educational Value**: The quiz serves as a valuable educational tool, reinforcing general knowledge through an engaging and interactive format.
