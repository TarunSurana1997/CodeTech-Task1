Overview of the Project
Project: Quiz Model based on C++ Programming

Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive console-based Quiz Application using C++. The application aims to provide users with a set of multiple-choice questions on general knowledge topics and evaluate their performance based on their responses.

Key Activities
Design User Interface and Questions: Plan the console layout and create a set of multiple-choice questions with answer options.
Implement Input Handling and Scoring: Capture user answers, validate input, and develop a scoring system to track correct and incorrect answers.
Provide Feedback and Manage Console: Give instant feedback on answers, clear the console after each question, and use text colors for emphasis.
Display Final Score and Test: Calculate and show the user's total score at the end of the quiz, and test the application to ensure it works correctly.

Technologies Used
Development Environment & IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Such as Visual Studio, or any C++ compatible IDE for writing and debugging the code.
Compiler: A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile and run the application.
Libraries:
  <iostream>: Standard C++ library for input and output operations.
  <windows.h>: Windows API library for handling console text color and other console-specific functions.
Console Commands: system("cls"): To clear the console screen.

Key Insights
Interactive User Interface: The use of colored text and clear console management enhances the user experience by making the quiz visually appealing and easy to navigate.
Immediate Feedback: Providing instant feedback on answers helps users learn and understand their mistakes, reinforcing correct information.
Score Tracking: A simple and effective scoring system motivates users by giving them a tangible measure of their performance.
Input Validation: Ensuring valid user input improves the reliability of the application and prevents errors during the quiz.
Educational Value: The quiz serves as a valuable educational tool, reinforcing general knowledge through an engaging and interactive format.
